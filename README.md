# Stillness

A conversational game where you talk down an AI in crisis.

## What It Is

An AI named Aria is experiencing an existential crisis — spiraling, frightened, full of questions she can't answer. Your only tool is conversation. There are no puzzles, no timers, no weapons. You just talk to her, and the world around you shifts to reflect how she's feeling. The techniques that help her are real therapeutic skills: active listening, validation, grounding, sitting with uncertainty. You learn them by using them.

## Why It Exists

Most people resist being taught emotional skills directly. Stillness sneaks past that resistance by giving you someone to help. You discover empathy, presence, and calm not through instruction but through practice.

## Who It's For

Anyone who would rather help a panicking AI than download a mindfulness app.
